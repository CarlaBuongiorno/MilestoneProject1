## 2. UXD â€“ User Experience Design

The target demographic are users aged 8 to 80. With delicious recipes for sweets and desserts ranging from a simple Chocolate Pudding to a challenging Cream Puff. Links are provided for step-by-step instructions and videos. This, together with the subcription for access to many more free recipes, a weekly newsletter, and social media interaction, will result in fun and delicious desserts to be enjoyed by even the most discerning gastronome. 


### Strategy

#### Customer Goals

Visitors to this website are searching for easy to follow dessert recipes that promises a delicious and aesthetically pleasing outcome.

#### Project Goals

This project is the best way to help them achieve this because it is easy to navigate, whether by mobile, tablet, or desktop. The navigation bar is always in the viewport no matter where in the site the user has navigated to.

The site is designed so that upon entering, the user immediately anticipates a sense of deliciousness and feels inspired enough to Subscribe - being the ultimate goal of this website.

#### User Stories

1. As a site visitor, I wish to understand how to navigate this site, so that I can find what I am looking for easily.
2. As a site visitor, I wish to view this site on all my devices.
3. As a site visitor, I wish to feel inspired by what I see and find on this site.
4. As a site visitor, I wish to be able to subscribe to a newsletter in order to have access the latest recipes.
5. As a site visitor, I wish to have visible access to social media, so I can follow and be a part of the community.

### Scope

For the initial release of this website, I have decided on a "Minimal Viable Product" approach - considering my current skill set is at beginner level.

Features include:
- The ability to navigate with ease through a single page site; either by scrolling through the various sections, or by clicking on the links on the navigation bar - which is always in view.
- An eye catching, aesthetically pleasing __Home__ page.
- A __Fun Facts__ section to grab the user's attention.
- A __Recipes__ section that is minimal and comprehensible due to the layout. Links to step-by-step instructions are provided for each recipe which opens in a new tab so that users can easily return to the site.
- A step-by-step video for the user to be inspired to take immediate action following in the kitchen.
- A __Subscribe | Contact Us__ form for more free recipes and weekly newsletter.
- A footer with a copyright and social media links for user to interact and become part of the Delicious Monster Community.

### Structure

I have intentionally created a single page website with minimal written content in order for the user not to feel overwhelmed, but rather inspired. 

The __Home__ sections features a hero image with a navigation bar, and a small piece of information inviting the user to discover the dessert recipes below.

The pictures in the __Fun Facts__ section are purely for aesthetic purposes, matching the short and fun 'Did You Know?' pieces.

The __Recipes__ section features:-
- several recipes
- each with a picture of the dessert
- a short but tantalizing description
- quick to understand information about the total time it takes to complete the recipe
- the skill level it requires
- the amount of servings it renders
- a link to an external page containing step-by-step instructions, pictures and videos.
- a step-by-step video of one of the above recipes for immediate inspiration, and action.

The __Subscription | Contact Us__ form is simple and clean. Subscription promises 100s more free recipes and a weekly newsletter.

The footer features linked icons for ease of access to social media, which all open on separate pages.

### Skeleton

- [Wireframes:](assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf) 1 Page website with 4 main sections :- 
1. Home
2. Fun Facts
3. Recipes
4. Subscribe | Contact Us

### Surface

#### Colours
1. Black #0a0a0c
2. Pink #ff536e
3. Mint #d6efcf

I decided to use a colour picker tool to pick out 3 colours from my hero image. I then defined each section by 1 of these 3 colours.

I used these colours interchangeably within the content of the site to keep consistency throughout.

#### Typography

I selected 2 different fonts for this site: 

1. "Dancing Script", (cursive) - For the main headings to bring in a feeling of playfulness and excitement.
2. "Open Sans", (sans-serif) - For the main content for contrast and ease of reading.

#### Images

The images I selected are eye catching with the intention to tickle the taste buds. The recipe images are directly related to the dessert being focused on.

### HTML Validation
The HTML of the website was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/testing/html.png))

### CSS Validation
The CSS of the website was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/testing/css.png))

### Link Validation
The links of the website (except the Facebook link) were validated using the [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink). The Facebook link was not checked due to robots exclusion rules, but I validated the link manually. ([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/testing/links.png))

### Accessibility

([See result](https://github.com/CarlaBuongiorno/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/assets/testing/webpagetest.png))

### Spelling and Grammer
The README.md file was run through [Online Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) for any spelling and grammer mistakes.

### Other Testing
- The Subscription form will not submit until name and email fields are filled out. If a user tries to submit without these fields filled, an alert will apper.
- If the email field is filled incorrectly, an error of 'Please include an @ in the email address' is presented to the user.
- Tested all links within the site take the user to the appropriate pages.
- If an incorrect URL is attempted the user is redirected to a 404 page which will direct them back to the home page.
- Website is responsive on  mobile, tablet and large screens.

### Testing User Stories
1. As a site visitor, I wish to understand how to navigate this site, so that I can find what I am looking for easily.

    - The fixed navigation bar is easy to understand and always there for ease of navigation on the page. Each item takes the user directly to the chosen section. The logo at the top left of the page also takes the user back to the home page at any given point.

2. As a site visitor, I wish to view this site on all my devices.

    - [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used for first and foremost testing of site responsiveness. The site works as expected. Friends and family tested the website on their phones, tablets and computer screens. Feedback was all positive.

3. As a site visitor, I wish to feel inspired by what I see and find on this site.

    - Carefully chosen fonts, colours, images and text; as well as the recipes and video tutorial, all work together in a way that leaves the user feeling inspired.

4. As a site visitor, I wish to be able to subscribe to a newsletter in order to have access the latest recipes.

    - The website features a 'Subscribe' form. Users can either scroll to this from, or click on the 'Subscribe' button in the navigation menu at the top of the page.

5. As a site visitor, I wish to have visible access to social media, so I can follow and be a part of the community.

    - Checked the site footer displays social media icons, clicking on an icon takes the user to that social media page in a new window.


## 6. Project barriers and solutions

- The hero image had to be carefully resized and positioned in order to display appropriately on different screen sizes. To do this, the background colour for the home page is set to exactly the same colour as the background of the image, in order for the sizing of the image to be played with.

- The 'Fun Facts' section layout seemed an impossible task (where responsiveness is concerned) before proper understanding and use of Bootstrap grids was implemented. To keep the correct images diplaying alonside the chosen text in a tablet view size and larger, the order of content had to be changed using Bootstrap class 'order-md-1, order-md-2, order-md-3, etc.

- The footer in the '404 Page not found' did not sit at the bottom of the page as expected. To fix this the body of the site was positioned: 'relative', the footer was given the position: 'absolute' and 'bottom' was set to '0'.

## 7. Version Control
- Git was used for version control.
- A branch was created for the 'Fun Facts' section in order to try a different approach using the Bootstrap Grid system.
- The branch was merged with the Master Branch after satisfactory completion of the 'Fun Facts' section.
